APIs underpin the internet but are still painful to work with. They are often untyped, unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.

Fern is a developer tool designed to generate SDKs, documentation, and servers from an API definition. Build with Fern to offer easy-to-use and well-documented APIs.

## Motivation

<div className="motivation">
  Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal tooling for developer experience. They provide client libraries in multiple languages and developer documentation that stays up-to-date. 

  We are building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all
  software companies.
