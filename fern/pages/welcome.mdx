APIs underpin the internet but are still painful to work with. They are often untyped, unstandardized, and out-of-sync across multiple sources of truth.

Fern is a developer tool designed to generate SDKs, documentation, and servers from an API definition. Build with Fern to offer easy-to-use and well-documented APIs.

## Motivation

<div className="motivation">
  Stripe, Twilio, and AWS have the resources to invest in internal tooling for developer experience. They provide client libraries in multiple languages and developer documentation that stays up-to-date. 

  We are building Fern to productize this process and make it accessible to all
  software companies.

## Go API First

Fern allows developers to design their API before building their app. This approach is known as `API First Development` and allows teams to iterate on their API design before writing any code. Use Fern to generate server code, SDKs, and documentation from your API definition.

<Tip>If you're starting from scratch, we recommend you start with the Fern Definition. Think of it as _OpenAPI simple_.</Tip>

Fern supports the following inputs
- [OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)](/learn/api-definition/openapi/overview)
- [Fern Definition](/learn/api-definition/fern/overview)
