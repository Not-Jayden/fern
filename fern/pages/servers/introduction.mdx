Fern's server-side generators output boilerplate application code that includes models and networking logic. This is intended for API First developers, who write their API definition before building their app. Fern supports generating backend code from an OpenAPI specification or Fern Definition. 

## Supported server frameworks

- Node.js [Express](/learn/express)
- Python [FastAPI](/learn/fastapi)
- Java [Spring Boot](/learn/spring)

## Why use Fern for server code generation?

1. **Save time**: generate boilerplate code instead of writing it.
1. **Compile-time safety**: get validation that your endpoints are being served correctly.
1. **Develop API-first**: design your API contract before you start building your app. Pick the best server framework for the job.
