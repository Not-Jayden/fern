When you subscribe to a Business or Enterprise plan, you can help your customers deeply understand your APIs with a feature-rich, 
fully-interactive API Playground. When you have an [API reference defined in your docs](/api-references/generate-api-ref), contact 
Fern support to enable the API Playground for your account! 


Example:

```yml docs.yml
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
```

More on customizing your API Reference [here](/learn/docs/api-references/customize-api-reference-layout). 

### Include more than one API Reference
To include multiple, distinct API definitions in your documentation, you can indicate which to include using the `api-name` property. The `api-name` corresponds to the name of the folder where your API definition is housed. 

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: Plant Store
    api-name: plant-api
  - api: Garden
    api-name: garden-api
```
